# Koronapsykoosi

This project was created for LUT University ReactJS code camp. Koronapsykoosi is a webpage that displays local area COVID-19 stats for Finnish cities and munincipalities.

The COVID-19 data displayed on the site is fetched from [THL's open data API](https://thl.fi/en/web/thlfi-en/statistics/statistical-databases/open-data/confirmed-corona-cases-in-finland-covid-19-), and the data about vaccinations is fetched from [Helsingin Sanomat open data API](https://github.com/HS-Datadesk/koronavirus-avoindata).

[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) should be enabled on the browser in order to have access to THL and HS API as there is no working back-end. <b>[This](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf)</b> is good plugin to use on Chrome for enabling CORS.
